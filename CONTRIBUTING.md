## CONTRIBUTING

This project was generated by the [dash-component-boilerplate](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate) it contains the minimal set of code required to create your own custom Dash component.

### Building Component Library

For VSCODE developers a development container definition is
available in *.devcontainer*.

#### Install tools manually

These steps are only needed if you intend to build the project directly
on your computer. To build the project you must have python
and node installed on your computer. Then:

Create a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source  .venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Build the project

Build the project:

    npm run build

Create tarball, first change the release version in package.json, then:

    rm -rf ./dist
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

The tarball is in *dist/dash_holoniq_components-<version>.tar.gz*

To install the tarball in a dash project:

    pip install dash_holoniq_components-<version>.tar.gz

#### Testing

Pytest and [Dash Duo](https://dash.plotly.com/testing) are used for testing. To run
these tests both the Chrome browser and Chrome driver must be installed. These are
allready installed in the VSCode Docker container. If you are note using remote containers
you must be install them first.

To run the tests:

    pytest

#### Publish

See [Create a production build and publish]

    twine upload dist/*

### Debugging the dash component JS source

To debug/single-step the JS component code in conjunction with a dash application:

In a terminal window start the dash application:

    python -m examples.form.index

Select debugger launch *1: JS Browser* and press F5. The chrome browser
will open and display your application. Enter breakpoints in your source
code eg *./src/lib/components/Location.react.js* as required.

### Debugging the python demo `usage.py`

In VSCODE select `2. Debug usage.py` from the launch options and press `F5` to launch the
Flask/Dash development server.

Open [http://localhost:8050](http://localhost:8050)

Set breakpoints as required.
